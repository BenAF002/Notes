2025 was a productive, but fragmented year. I worked through Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right" (LADR) fairly comprehensively (though I didn't dip into multilinear algebras with the later chapters) and found it tremendously valuable. Likewise for Bishop's "Deep Learning", which I am still dipping into at leisure.

In 2026, I want to introduce more sturcture. So, I am going to call my shot here by laying out what I hope to achieve.

Goals:
- Abbott's "Understanding Analysis": Ch 1-3
- Cover and Thomas' "Information Theory": As much as I can manage, but at least Ch 1-5, 7-12, and 14
- Gelman's "Bayesian Data Analysis": As much as I can manage, but at least through part 4 (regression models)
- Stein's "Complex Analysis": Ch 1-3
- Cox's "Ideals and Varieties": Ch 1-2

By the end of 2026 I'd like to have the foundations with which to begin Sumio Watanabe's "Mathematical Theory of Bayesian Statistics" and their series of lecture notes on Singular Learning Theory [here](https://sites.google.com/view/sumiowatanabe/home/singular-learning-theory)
